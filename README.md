# HackBio-Biocoding-Internship
## **About the Internship**  
The **HackBio BioCoding in R and Python** internship is a virtual program designed to equip participants with coding skills for biological data analysis. This program fosters a collaborative learning environment where interns work in teams, engage with mentors, and complete coding-based tasks that enhance their technical proficiency. The internship is organized into stages, with each stage focusing on a different coding exercise or real-world problem.

## **Stage-0 Task: Team Introduction**
The first task of this internship required us to create an organized representation of our team members' details using R or Python. This task emphasized the importance of structuring and managing data efficiently, a fundamental skill in coding for biological applications.

### **Task Requirements:**
Store the following details for each team member:
- Full Name
- Slack Username
- Email Address
- Hobbies
- Country of Origin
- Academic Background
- Preferred Programming Language

### **Task implementation:**
The code snippet for this task, included in this repository, defines a data frame in R that systematically stores and displays our team membersâ€™ details. This provides a structured approach to organizing data, setting the foundation for handling more complex datasets in future tasks.

For this task, R was used to structure and store the details of all team members in an organized and readable format.  

1. **Creating a Data Frame**:  
   The `data.frame()` function was used to create a data frame containing team members details. Each column represents a **specific attribute** and each **row corresponds to a team member**.  

2. **Defining Data Using `c()` Function**:  
   Inside the `data.frame()`, the c() function was used to list values for each column. This allowed to store multiple data points efficiently within the data frame.  

3. **Printing the Data Frame**:  
   Finally, the `print()` function was used to display the structured data in the console, making it easy to read.
